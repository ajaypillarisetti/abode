## ABODE, the Air Pollution Burden of Disease Explorer 
ABODE estimates health changes due to interventions designed to lower exposures to household air pollution (HAP) of household members currently using unclean fuels (wood, dung, coal, kerosene, and others). These interventions could be due to cleaner burning stoves, cleaner fuels, providing chimneys or other ventilation changes, movement of the traditional hearth to a different location, motivating changes in behavior, or a combination of the above. ABODE can also estimate changes in health due to changes in ambient air pollution from household interventions that may not be measured in normal household exposure measurements. With some care in entering input parameters, it can be used for evaluating other interventions to reduce HAP, including those for lighting and spaceheating.

ABODE can also estimate health changes due to altered ambient air pollution resulting from transitions to clean fuels. Currently, this estimation only applies to the households in which your program intervenes; that is, it does not apply to the country as a whole.

ABODE uses background disease rates and relationships between exposure to PM2.5 and health outcomes described as part of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's 2017 Global Burden of Disease and Comparative Risk Assessment efforts. It uses country-level estimates of ambient air pollution from IHME and HEI's 2019 State of Global Air report.

Meaningful use of ABODE requires field work at the intervention dissemination site to demonstrate pollution exposures before and after the intervention in a representative sample of households. As each country's health and HAP situation is different, ABODE currently contains the background data necessary to conduct analysis in 195 countries.
